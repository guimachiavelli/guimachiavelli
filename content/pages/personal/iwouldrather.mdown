# I Would Rather My Streets (2011)

Identity system I designed for my final project on [Hyper Island](http://hyperisland.com). The project itself was an art installation of QR codes with site-specific micro-stories spread around Stockholm. The identity is composed of situationist maps that can guide the viewer around the art installation.

Since I had a bit of free time, I also wrote three texts around the themes of [narratives](http://discourse.guimachiavelli.com/dwelling-and-detournement/), [situationism](http://discourse.guimachiavelli.com/site-specific-narratives/) and [memory](http://discourse.guimachiavelli.com/i-would-rather-my-streets/). Yeah, I'm that kind of person.
