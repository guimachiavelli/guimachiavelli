# I Would Rather My Streets (2011)

[I Would Rather My Streets][link-site] was an installation and my final project for [Hyper Island](http://hyperisland.com). I spread QR codes with site-specific micro-stories spread around Stockholm.

> I always pictured coming home with someone and sitting on these benches, looking at the sun rising. I did it alone, however.

I developed an identity system is composed of situationist maps that can guide the viewer around the art installation.

The site was just a single html page and used the google maps api plus some javascript for the paths ([Github link][git]).

Since I had a bit of free time, I also wrote three texts around the themes of [narratives](http://discourse.guimachiavelli.com/dwelling-and-detournement/), [situationism](http://discourse.guimachiavelli.com/site-specific-narratives/) and [memory](http://discourse.guimachiavelli.com/i-would-rather-my-streets/). Yeah, I'm that kind of person.
