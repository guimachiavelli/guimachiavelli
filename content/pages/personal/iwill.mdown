# I Will (2011)


I created this site which corrupts the avatars of twitter users who say "I Will". It was a conceptual exploration on how one's wishes affect one's future. Online at [http://iwill.guimachiavelli.com][link-site]

This was created for Werkplaats Typografie and ISIA Urbino's summerschol. Our assignment was to create a project around the idea of time; we also had a jolly good time there. The whole thing was made in PHP (based on open-sourced code from Recyclism) plus the usual front-end stuff.
