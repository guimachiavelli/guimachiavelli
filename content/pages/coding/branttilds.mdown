# Brant Tilds (2008)


Small site I designed and developed as a designer at Mobe for a musician specialized in latin jazz. Back-end in Wordpress, front-end in html/css/js. Online at [http://branttilds.com][link-site].

After the site, we were asked to design the cover of his first solo album. Which I've never seen in real life, so I only have a <del>shitty</del> bad quality scan of the front. He seemed very happy on the phone, though. For real.
