# 4EVA (2012)

Project realized in collaboration with [Pinar&Viola][link-collab1]. The idea started after being commissioned by phone-expo.nl on creating a project around cellphones and the theme "Hey! How are you?" Thinking about how exaggeratedly perfect – surpassing stepfordian levels – are the virtual girlfriends and boyfriends one can usually find on the internet, we created a message service that delivers intimate pictures and texts from a perfect lover.

Besides helping with the concept and research, I was in charge of writing the copy, programming the message sending system and providing emotional support to all involved. The images, instead, were created by [Pinar&Viola][link-collab1].

Initially thought to work as only SMSes in The Netherlands, we expanded the project to work also by e-mail.

4EVA was coded in PHP+MySQL, plus the front-end obviously in HTML/CSS/JS. The texts were created from a collage of love declarations around social media. The SMS sending bit was finished with the help of [Jan van Bruggen][link-collab2].
